ðŸŽ¯ Roadmap for Next Year (3rd Year AI+DS Student)
ðŸ“Œ Semester 1 of 3rd Year

Main Focus â†’ Python + AI/ML foundations + continue DevOps

Python (if not already strong)

Revise Python OOPs, functions, error handling.

Data libraries â†’ NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Machine Learning Basics

Learn Scikit-Learn

Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, SVM, Clustering.

Projects:

Spam email classifier

Movie recommender

Stock price predictor

DevOps â€“ Level Up

Docker (multi-container apps)

CI/CD (Jenkins / GitHub Actions)

Start Cloud basics (AWS/GCP/Azure free tier).

ðŸ“Œ Semester 2 of 3rd Year

Main Focus â†’ Deep Learning + MLOps (AI + DevOps combo)

Deep Learning

TensorFlow / PyTorch

ANN, CNN, RNN basics

Projects:

Handwritten digit recognition

Face mask detector (Computer Vision)

Chatbot (NLP)

MLOps (AI + DevOps Integration)

Model deployment with Flask/Django + Docker

Use Kubernetes basics (deploy ML model as a microservice)

Version control for ML models (DVC, MLflow).

Competitive Coding (Optional but Helpful for Placements)

Continue Java/Python DSA practice (medium-level LeetCode).

ðŸ“… Weekly Routine for Next Year

Monâ€“Fri (1 hr daily) â†’ ML theory + Python practice

Sat (3 hrs) â†’ DevOps tools (Docker/Kubernetes/Cloud)

Sun (3 hrs) â†’ Projects (AI + DevOps integration)

ðŸŽ“ End of 3rd Year â†’ Youâ€™ll Have

âœ… Strong ML + AI foundation
âœ… DevOps skills + Cloud basics
âœ… Portfolio with at least 3â€“4 good projects (mix of ML & DevOps)
âœ… Good DSA base (from this yearâ€™s Java) for internships/placements
