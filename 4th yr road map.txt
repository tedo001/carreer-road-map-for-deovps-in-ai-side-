🎯 Roadmap for 4th Year (Final Year AI + DS)
📌 Semester 1 (Start of 4th Year)

Main Focus → Industry-Ready Skills + Resume Building

Finalize Your Career Direction

If you like AI/ML/Data Science → Specialize in ML/DL/NLP/Computer Vision.

If you like DevOps/Cloud → Specialize in Cloud + Kubernetes + Automation.

If you like Software/Backend → Keep polishing Java + Spring Boot.

👉 By now, you should pick 1 primary career path, but keep the other as backup.

Major Projects (Portfolio-Level)

AI Path:

End-to-End ML pipeline (data collection → training → deployment)

NLP project (chatbot, sentiment analysis)

Computer vision project (face recognition, defect detection)

DevOps Path:

CI/CD pipeline with Docker + Kubernetes + Cloud deployment

Infrastructure automation project (Terraform, Ansible basics)

Hybrid: Deploy an ML model with MLOps tools

Internship / Research Paper (if possible)

Try to publish a paper (AI/ML students often do this in India).

Or get a summer internship before 4th year starts.

📌 Semester 2 (Final Semester)

Main Focus → Placements + Career Prep

Placement Preparation

DSA (Java/Python): Focus on LeetCode medium-level problems.

Revise OS, DBMS, CN (common interview subjects).

Practice mock interviews.

Final-Year Project

Make it resume-worthy + demo-ready.

Example:

“AI-powered Medical Image Classifier with Cloud Deployment”

“CI/CD pipeline for deploying ML models on Kubernetes”

Resume + GitHub + LinkedIn

Showcase 5–6 good projects (mix of AI + DevOps).

Keep clean, professional GitHub repos.

Post small project updates on LinkedIn (helps recruiters notice you).

📅 Weekly Routine (Final Year)

Mon–Thu (1–2 hrs daily) → DSA + Interview prep

Fri–Sat (2–3 hrs) → Work on final-year project

Sun (2–3 hrs) → Build portfolio + resume polishing

✅ End of 4th Year → You’ll Graduate With

Strong skills in AI/ML or DevOps (whichever you choose)

A portfolio of projects on GitHub

Internship or final-year project to show in interviews

DSA + CS fundamentals for placement tests

A clear career path (AI engineer / ML engineer / DevOps engineer / Cloud engineer / Backend developer).
