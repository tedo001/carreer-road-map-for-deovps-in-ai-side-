🎯 Your Semester Game Plan
1️⃣ Java (DSA + OOPs) → Main Focus This Semester

Since your subjects are in Java, don’t skip it.

Learn Core Java properly:

OOPs (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism)

Collections (ArrayList, HashMap, Set, Queue)

Exception handling, File handling

DSA in Java:

Arrays, Strings

Linked List

Stack & Queue

Trees, Graph basics

Sorting & Searching

✅ Benefit → This will help you crack placements, because most companies test DSA.

2️⃣ DevOps (Side Skill This Semester)

You said you also have a DevOps subject — perfect 👇

Start small:

Linux basics (commands, shell scripting)

Git & GitHub (version control)

Docker basics (run a container, build an image)

✅ Benefit → By 3rd year, you’ll already know DevOps while others will start late.

3️⃣ Python (Self-Learning, Slow Pace)

Even though semester is Java-heavy, don’t ignore Python (because your AI/DS degree needs it).

Just 2–3 hrs per week:

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Small data analysis projects

✅ Benefit → You won’t lose touch with AI/DS track.

📅 Weekly Routine (This Semester)

Mon–Fri (1 hr daily) → Java (DSA practice + subject theory)

Sat (2 hrs) → DevOps basics (Linux + Git/Docker)

Sun (2 hrs) → Python data analysis mini-projects

📌 Example Mini Projects (This Semester)

Java → Implement a Linked List, Stack, Queue with classes

DevOps → Run a simple “Hello World” app in Docker

Python → Analyze IPL/Netflix dataset with Pandas

✅ End of this Semester Outcome:

You’ll be strong in Java DSA (good for placements).

You’ll have DevOps basics (head start for cloud/automation career).

You’ll keep Python alive (so AI/DS won’t feel new later).
